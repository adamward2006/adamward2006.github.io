<h1>Stephen Hawking </h1>
<p>By Adam Ward</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking was born on the 300th anniversary of Galileo (8th of January 1942). He was  also born into a family of thinkers. His Mum was Scottish and found her way into Oxford University in the 1930s, a time when women were rare to get into college. His father was also able to get into college and was a respected medical doctor and had a speciality in tropical diseases. His father,Frank Hawking wanted his eldest son to go into medicine but the young Hawking was facinated by science and the sky. In 1950, Frank took work to manage the Division of Parasitology at the National Institute of Medical Research, and spent the winter months in Africa doing research. Later in life (17 10 be presise) Stephen wanted to get a degree in maths but Oxford Universaty did not do mathematics so Hawking decided to do phisics (to be more presise
cosmology).
</p>
<p>At Universaty Hawking started to notice problems with his health
but didn't even do anything about it until 1936!But as soon as his father
noticed something he took Stephen to see a doctor.After two weeks in the clinic 21 year old Hawking was diagnosed with ALS and the doctors gave him 2 and a half years to live but amazingly he is 73!As soon as he thought he was going to die (when he was 21 by the way) he started to work his head off (not really) and after a couple of year of work he discoverd black holes.</p>

<p> I admire Stephen Hawking because he cannot move anything and he is a lot better than people that can move everything. He has defied the odds and he has never let his illness get in the way of his life's work.
